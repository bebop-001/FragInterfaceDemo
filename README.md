FragInterfaceDemo
=================

Simple Fragment demo that shows use of callbacks and onAttach to insure that fragment users have instituted the callback.  MainActivity has 2 fragments each with a button and EditText item and a 3rd area that has an EditText item.  The buttens in the fragments send their EditText values to the MainActivity via the callback and it idsplays them in its EditText item.
